                                  Credit Exemptions will be granted not only for studies completed at an RTO, but at any authorised issuing organisation, such as a university. In such cases, an analysis as to the equivalence of the study completed with the relevant unit/s or module/s would need to be completed before any credit exemption will be granted.
                                    The Academic Manager will substantiate and verify the information provided by the student e.g. Testamur, Record of Results or Statement of Attainment by contacting the organisation that issued the documentation and confirming that the content is valid.
                                    Approved student credit exemptions may modify the duration of the students’ course; all students will be advised of the expected duration that specifically applies to them.
                                    Students may use Australian International Institute of Technology’s appeal procedures if dissatisfied with the outcome of their application of Credit for prior studies within 10 days of receiving their outcome
                                    Finally, the granting of a course credit transfer exemptions may affect course tuition fees as well as the duration of the course and the student’s CoE.

                           All new or continuing Australian International Institute of Technology’s students undertaking nationally recognised training require a USI in order to receive their Qualification or Statement of Attainment (SOA). Australian International Institute of Technology meets the requirements of the Student Identifier scheme and will not issue AQF certification documentation to a student without being in receipt of a verified Student Identifier for that student, unless an exemption applies under the Student Identifiers Act 2014.
